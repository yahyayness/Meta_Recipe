You can try it yourself in [netlify](https://tender-tesla-6d5acb.netlify.app/).

You can view the data in [heroku](https://dg-backend.herokuapp.com/).

The frontend code (React.js) [you can find here](https://github.com/noamdom/dg-app/tree/frontend).

The backend code (Python - Django framework) [you can find here](https://github.com/noamdom/dg-app/tree/backend).

#  Background
This app is my final project of my BA studies, and it's a cooperation 
with [Hybrid Lab, The School of Computer 
Science and Engineering in The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,](http://digitalgastronomy.co/)
in research of 'Digital Gastronomy'. 

This app is an experiment to personalize recipe by a digital agent and this app is proof 
for that concept.



# Description
This app will analyze your recipe.
During the process you will choice in the app what dish 
you wish to eat (Lettuce warp \ Stir Fry \ Carrot cake), and what type of recipe you 
prefer (Kosher \ Vegan \ Ketogenic). In response the app will give you  a visualization
 how the recipe's ingredients impact on:
* Aroma intensity
* Taste intensity
* Environmental Impact
